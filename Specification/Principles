Language Design Principles:
	- A Programming Language should expose functionality and provide detailed control to the developer.
	- A Programming Language should assist the developer the developer in following best practices, but provide a way to override such ristrictions.

General Programming Principles:
	- Single Responsibility Principle:
		Every entity (Function/Method, Class, Module, Variable, Program) should be responsible for 1 and only 1 thing.
	- Responsibility Locality:
		Every responsibility should be located in a single location or grouped under a single collection.
	- Namespaced Libraries' Code:
		Libraries's code should be under one or more namespaces. Only leaf programs are allowed to violate this principle.
